# Three-body problem

The Three-Body Problem is a classic and notoriously challenging mathematical and physical problem in the field of celestial mechanics. It involves the study of the motion of three massive bodies (typically celestial objects like stars, planets, or galaxies) under the influence of their mutual gravitational attraction. Unlike the simpler two-body problem, where the motion can be precisely predicted, the Three-Body Problem lacks a general analytical solution. The behavior of such a system can be chaotic and highly sensitive to initial conditions, making long-term predictions extremely difficult. This problem has profound implications for our understanding of celestial dynamics, chaos theory, and the limitations of classical physics in complex systems. It remains a subject of ongoing research and computational exploration in astrophysics and mathematics.
